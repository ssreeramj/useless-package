# Useless Python package

This is definitely the most useless python package.

You can try out this package using the command

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ mup`

After installing the package, paste these lines in a python file

`
from mup import do_something`

`do_something.greet()`

Enjoy!
